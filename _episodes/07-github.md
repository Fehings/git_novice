Version control really comes into its own when we begin to collaborate with
other people.  We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; the
only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.

Systems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories.  In
practice, though, it's easiest to use one copy as a central hub, and to keep it
on the web rather than on someone's laptop.  Most programmers use hosting
services like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) or
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) to hold those master copies; we'll explore the pros
and cons of this in the final section of this lesson.

Let's start by sharing the changes we've made to our current project with the
world.  Log in to GitHub, then click on the icon in the top right corner to
create a new repository called `surgery_outcomes`:

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 1)](../fig/github-create-repo-01.png)

Name your repository "planets" and then click "Create Repository".

Note: Since this repository will be connected to a local repository, it needs to be empty. Leave 
"Initialize this repository with a README" unchecked, and keep "None" as options for both "Add 
.gitignore" and "Add a license." See the "GitHub License and README files" exercise below for a full 
explanation of why the repository needs to be empty.

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 2)](../fig/github-create-repo-02.png)

As soon as the repository is created, GitHub displays a page with a URL and some
information on how to configure your local repository:

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 3)](../fig/github-create-repo-03.png)

This effectively does the following on GitHub's servers:

~~~
$ mkdir planets
$ cd planets
$ git init
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Note that our local repository still contains our earlier work on `mars.txt`, but the
remote repository on GitHub appears empty as it doesn't contain any files yet.

The next step is to connect the two repositories.  We do this by making the
GitHub repository a [remote]({{ page.root}}{% link reference.md %}#remote) for the local repository.
The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the string we need to
identify it:

![Where to Find Repository URL on GitHub](../fig/github-find-repo-string.png)

Click on the 'HTTPS' link to change the [protocol]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#protocol) from SSH to HTTPS.

> ## HTTPS vs. SSH
>
> We use HTTPS here because it does not require additional configuration.  After
> the workshop you may want to set up SSH access, which is a bit more secure, by
> following one of the great tutorials from
> [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys),
> [Atlassian/Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-ssh-for-git-728138079.html)
> and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/03/04/add-ssh-key-screencast/)
> (this one has a screencast).
{: .callout}

![Changing the Repository URL on GitHub](../fig/github-change-repo-string.png)

Copy that URL from the browser, go into the local `surgery_outcomes` repository, and run
this command:

~~~
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/surgery_outcomes.git
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Make sure to use the URL for your repository.

`origin` is a local name used to refer to the remote repository. It could be called
anything, but `origin` is a convention that is often used by default in git
and GitHub, so it's helpful to stick with this unless there's a reason not to.

We can check that the command has worked by running `git remote -v`:

~~~
$ git remote -v
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
origin   https://github.com/username/surgery_outcomes.git (push)
origin   https://github.com/username/surgery_outcomes.git (fetch)
~~~
{: .output}

We'll discuss remotes in more detail in the next episode, while
talking about how they might be used for collaboration.

Once the remote is set up, this command will push the changes from
our local repository to the repository on GitHub:

~~~
$ git push origin master
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~

~~~
{: .output}


> ## The '-u' Flag
>
> You may see a `-u` option used with `git push` in some documentation.  This
> option is synonymous with the `--set-upstream-to` option for the `git branch`
> command, and is used to associate the current branch with a remote branch so
> that the `git pull` command can be used without any arguments. To do this,
> simply use `git push -u origin master` once the remote has been set up.
{: .callout}

We can pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:

~~~
$ git pull origin master
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.
~~~
{: .output}

Pulling has no effect in this case because the two repositories are already
synchronized.  If someone else had pushed some changes to the repository on
GitHub, though, this command would download them to our local repository.
