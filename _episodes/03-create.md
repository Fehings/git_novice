Once Git is configured,
we can start using it.

We have just started a project evaluating different surgical procedures for treating epilepsy, and we want to start version controlling our data, notes and models to ensure that we don't lose any information and to be able to share with collaborators.


First, let's create a directory in `Desktop` folder for our work and then move into that directory:

~~~
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir surgery_outcomes
$ cd surgery_outcomes
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Then we tell Git to make `surgery_outcomes` a [repository]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#repository)
-- a place where Git can store versions of our files:


~~~
$ git init
~~~
{: .language-bash}

It is important to note that `git init` will create a repository that
includes subdirectories and their files---there is no need to create
separate repositories nested within the `surgery_outcomes` repository, whether
subdirectories are present from the beginning or added later. Also, note
that the creation of the `surgery_outcomes` directory and its initialization as a
repository are completely separate processes.

If we use `ls` to show the directory's contents,
it appears that nothing has changed:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `surgery_outcomes` called `.git`:

~~~
$ ls -a
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
.	..	.git
~~~
{: .output}

Git uses this special subdirectory to store all the information about the project, 
including all files and sub-directories located within the project's directory.
If we ever delete the `.git` subdirectory,
we will lose the project's history.

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
~~~
{: .output}

If you are using a different version of `git`, the exact
wording of the output might be slightly different.


> ## Correcting `git init` Mistakes

> (for example within an existing repository) you can always remove it.

> > ### Background
> > Removing files from a git repository needs to be done with caution. To remove files from the working tree and not from your working directory, use
> > ~~~
> > $ rm filename
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-bash}
> > 
> > The file being removed has to be in sync with the branch head with no updates. If there are updates, the file can be removed by force by using the `-f` option. Similarly a directory can be removed from git using `rm -r dirname` or `rm -rf dirname`.

> > Git keeps all of its files in the `.git` directory.
> > You can just remove the `.git` to stop a set of files being version controlled.
